         &amp; Vue's Reactivity System
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>WHAT IS REACTIVE?</b><br>
        <br>
        Reactive programming is programming with asynchronous data streams.
        <br>
        <br>
        A stream is a sequence of ongoing events ordered in time that offer some hooks with which to observe it.
        <br><br>
        When we use reactive premises for building applications, this means it's very easy to update state in reaction to events.
        <br><br>
        Vue takes the object, walks through its properties and converts them to getter/setters
        <br>
        <br>
        The Vue instance is the middleman between the DOM and the business logic
        <br><br>
        Watch updates the DOM only if it's required- performing calculations in JS is really performant but accessing the DOM is not. So we have a Virtual DOM which is like a copy, but parsed in JavaScript
        <br><br>
        It will only update the DOM for things that need to be changed, which is faster.
        <br><br>
        Good for asynchronous updates,and updates/transitions with data changes
        <br><br>
